# Install essentials (copy and paste all together into terminal)
apt update
apt install python3
apt install pip
apt install git
apt install sqlite3
apt install screen 
apt install cpulimit (optional, if you don't want the server to use all the CPU on the simulation)

# Clone the repo
git clone "https://github.com/mrs714/CaptureTheFlag"

# Python dependencies (all at once with: pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt)
pip install flask
pip install pygame
pip install moviepy
pip install pysqlite
pip install restrictedpython
pip install pushbullet.py (optional, if you want to use the check_server.py file to get notifications on your phone when the server is down, you'll have to modify the file to add your API key)

# Power up
There are two files that need to be run. The first one is the app itself, with flask for the moment.
The other is the simulation_launch.py which can be normally run with python3.
To simplify things, you can use ./start_server which also looks for updates, and ./stop_server to stop the server.
